# Getting Started

Create your own **code battles** competition by implementing your game in Python using this library, **without doing** web development!

You will only need to do the following:

- Fork this repository.
- Create a Firebase project with Firestore and enable Email and Password authentication.
- Implement your game in Python:
  - Declare your GameState
  - Create a simulator which simulates a single step of your game
  - Create a renderer which renders the current game state on a canvas (with utility methods so you don't have to do pixel calculations by yourself!)
  - Declare your API
  - Create an implementation for your API

# Roadmap
